            I am a Systems Engineer with experience managing Linux-based infrastructure

            My expertise includes cloud infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, 
            automation with Ansible and Bash, CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub, 
            and containerization with Docker.
